# Welcome!

Welcome to my blog! I'm joining the group of people that have a blog online and like everyone, I want to talk about my passions online to the world. I'm passionate abonut computer science, music, and more. I hope you enjoy my discussions on here!

## Current Plans
A few weeks ago, I finalized my research paper that I'm working on. The paper deals in the realm of computational linguistics. Specifically, I talk about machine translation - a short history, the benefits and ethical concerns, and my opinions on machine translation today. Expect to see a blog-friendly version of that paper soon!

## The Future

I honestly don't have any plans for the future. I'll probably focus on computer-related topics, but I also want to keep these blog interesting. Regardless, I hope you join me and we'll see what happens!
