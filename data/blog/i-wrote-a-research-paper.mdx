# The 5 Ws (and H)

I wrote a research paper! Let's talk about it using the 5 Ws and H - who, what, when, where, why, and how.

## Who?

I wrote it (obviously). I had help from a mentor though, so I didn't do it alone.

## What?

My paper talks about machine translation - the history of machine translation, its benefits, its ethical concerns, and my opinions and conclusions.

## When?

I spent a few months writing it. Each week, I would write another portion of it, chunking through it slowly. I also used an outline to keep me on track with my writing.

## Why?

Two reasons. First, to be frank - it looks good for colleges. But also, it gave me a firsthand experience with writing research papers, which will make it easier for me in the future. Finally, I was curious about machine translation, so I just wanted to learn about it.

## How?

Like I said earlier, I started by making a small outline - 2 pages at most - that had my headings and topics in order. I then started writing the paper, finding other good research papers to cite and expanding my outline as I went. In the end, my outline doubled in size and my paper came out to around 3,000 words.

## Can I see it?

Of course! I plan to put a version of it on my blog soon, stay tuned.
