# My opinions on AP Computer Science A (plus other things)

Hello internet! I have some random thoughts to share.

So, some context before we start. I'm currently taking AP CSA through FLVS, or Florida Virtual School. It's a state-run online "school", where students in Florida can have their entire education hosted online or physical-school students can add an extra class to their schedule without it taking up an additional period.

AP CSA is a really interesting course in my opinion, and definitely one of my favorites. It's fun and somewhat challenging, instead of being *only* challenging like many other AP courses (AP Biology...).

## Java: you love it or hate it

Despite the somewhat common sentiment about Java, I think it's good and fits well into an AP course curriculum. Granted, I've taken many past college-level courses on Java, so it's not very difficult to me. However, there's a reason why so many courses still use Java: it's universal and teaches what curriculums want.

Do I like Java? I'm not sure. It's definitely more intuitive to me now, but I don't know if me two years ago would agree with me now. I really don't think some Java concepts are intuitive to the layman wanting to pick up programming, especially with concepts like objects, constructors, overloading, etc. I know for a fact that when I first read it in a textbook, I was so confused!
