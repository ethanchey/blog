Ever wanted to learn about what made the song Despacito so popular, or that orchestra hit sound that you've heard in so many songs (like in Soulja Boy's "Crank That")? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@synthet7">Synthet</a>'s your guy.

At the time of writing, Synthet is sitting at 963 thousand subscribers, and quite frankly, I think he deserves more. The secret to his videos is the editing -- every video follows a rhythm. In other words, a constant beat runs through the video that leads you into the video's topic, and his ability to demonstrate what he's saying immediately after results in such intuitive learning.

Go check Synthet out, and then check back here every so often for more cool YouTube recommendations!
