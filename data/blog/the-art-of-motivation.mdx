Life is strange. One month, you're working on a bunch of projects and enjoying your life. Another month, you're completely unmotivated to do anything.

I experienced this to such a strong degree this past school year, and especially towards the end. It's weird, I've never experienced such unmotivation ever before.

And yet, I didn't *realize* how I felt until looking back recently. I think it's just when you're so in it, you don't stop to look around at your surroundings. You just keep working until it's finished.

I wish I had some magical solution to staying motivated in your passions, but truth be told, I don't. I think this experience taught me to not take on so much at once -- something I already knew, but never really took seriously until now. Knowing your limits, especially in life, is important.

I'm more writing this to emphasize that you shouldn't lose focus on what makes you, *you*. It's a cliché, sure, but it's a true cliché. Just because you're experiencing tough times in life, doesn't mean you should abandon your passions, your hobbies, your personality. Like with all things in life, everything will pass with time. That family issue, that relationship, that job, whatever it is: in time, this too will pass.

This also is a reminder to myself in the future. I will inevitably forget what junior year of high school was like and forget the experiences of that year. I hope writing this down will help me (and maybe others) remember these lessons. After all, what good is a lesson if you don't apply it?
