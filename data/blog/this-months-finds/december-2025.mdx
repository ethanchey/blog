Hello and welcome to a new, monthly series on this blog that I've so affectionately titled "This Month's Finds"! Every month, I will make a blog post just like this of cool stuff I've found online that I want to share with others. With that, let's get into this month's finds, focusing on YouTube channels!

### Drawing every flag in Microsoft PowerPoint??

Have you ever sat in a presentation and suddenly wondered, "hm, can I draw the flag of Uzbekistan in this?"

No? Congratulations, now you can learn if you really *can* draw every flag! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QSVhgrqVE">This video</a> by Dr. Zye on YouTube chronicles the narrator going insane as he determines to figure out how to draw every SINGLE flag. Great storytelling and definitely worth a watch!

### Synthet: making masterful music videos

Ever wanted to learn about what made the song Despacito so popular, or that orchestra hit sound that you've heard in so many songs (like in Soulja Boy's "Crank That")? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@synthet7">Synthet</a>'s your guy.

At the time of writing, Synthet is sitting at 963 thousand subscribers, and quite frankly, I think he deserves more. The secret to his videos is the editing -- every video follows a rhythm. In other words, a constant beat runs through the video that leads you into the video's topic, and his ability to demonstrate what he's saying immediately after results in such intuitive learning.

### "What if we teleported the oceans to Mars?"

*What if everyone jumped at once?*

*What if we put a pool on the moon?*

Wanted to answer your imagination's wildest questions and more? Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xkcd_whatif">xkcd's What If?</a>, a YouTube channel that adapts <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcds</a> into bite-size videos. With the animations and in-depth responses to frankly stupid questions, these videos are always worth watching.
